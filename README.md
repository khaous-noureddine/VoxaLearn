# VoxaLearn 🎙️🌍  
VoxaLearn is an AI-powered tool that helps users practice and improve pronunciation in multiple languages.

It allows you to:
- 🎧 Record your voice  
- 🗣️ Transcribe speech using a multilingual ASR model (Whisper)  
- 🧠 Compare what you said to a target sentence using an LLM  
- ✍️ Receive clear feedback, corrections, and explanations  

This is an early version (V1).  
The project will evolve with:
- real-time feedback  
- multilingual TTS  
- voice cloning  
- pronunciation scoring
